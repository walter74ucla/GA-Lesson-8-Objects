=========================================



Notes:

*Activity*

- In your Chrome Console, create an Object called `bigfoot` with propterties of `shoesize`, `height`, and `current location`. 
- Add some more properties you come up with on your own. 
- BONUS: Add a method (or function, same deal) to your bigfoot object!
- **Copy-paste your code as a reply to this instruction in Slack**
- 4 min.


=========================================

*Activity*

- In your Chrome Console, create a new Object and give it four properties and a method using what we just learned. 
- Retrieve each property and call the method. Remember you need `()` to envoke a funtion
- See what happenes when you retrieve a method from a function without calling it using `()`. 
- Thumbs up when done! 
- 5 min.


=========================================

*Activity*

- In your Chrome Console, create a new Object and give it four properties and a method using bracket notation. 
- Retrieve each property and call the method. Remember you need `()` to envoke a funtion
- Thumbs up when done! 
- 3 min.

PART II

=========================================

*Activity*

- In a javaScript file, create a new Object myFatCat and give it five properties, including a weight. 
- Define a method `eat()` on your object that increases myFatCat's weight by one pound, using the `this` keyword.
- Define another method `meow()` **outside of the object**. 
- Add the `meow()` method to the myFatCat object
- Make the cat:
 - meow
 - console.log it's weight
 - eat
 - meow again
 - console.log it's weight again
- Paste your code in the thread below when done
- 7 min. 

=========================================

*Activity*

- using one of the objects you used earlier today, use a for..in loop to console.log each key AND value
- Paste your code in the thread below when done
- 7 min. 

=========================================

*Activity*

- Create a `monkey` object, which has the following properties:
 - `name`
 - `species`
 - `foodsEaten`
- And the following methods:
 - `eatSomething(thingAsString)`
 - `introduce`: producers a string introducing itself, including its name, species, and what it's eaten
- Create 3 monkeys total. Make sure all 3 monkeys have all properties set and methods defined.
- Exercise your monkeys by retrieving their properties and using their methods. Practice using both syntaxes for retrieving properties (dot notation and brackets).
- Paste your code in the thread below when done
- 20 min.
